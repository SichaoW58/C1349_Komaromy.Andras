## Update R

We use [installr](https://talgalili.github.io/installr/) package to update R.

Run following code to update R. Not working

```{r}
check.for.updates.R()
```


```{r}
#| label: Install-installr

if(!require("installr")) install.packages('installr')
library("installr")

```


```{r}
#| label: update-r
#| eval: false

updateR() # this will open dialog boxes to take you through the steps.
# OR use:
# updateR(TRUE) # this will use common defaults and will be the safest/fastest option
```


```{r}
#|label: install-multi-version
# step by step functions:
check.for.updates.R() # tells you if there is a new version of R or not.
install.R() # download and run the latest R installer
copy.packages.between.libraries() # copy your packages to the newest R installation from the one version before it (if ask=T, it will ask you between which two versions to perform the copying)
```
Notice that because the admin restriction, I can only install under my profile. So I have to use ctrl+click to open and choose which R version to run.


```{r}
R.version.string
```
